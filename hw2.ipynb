The histograms show the distribution of the feature values in the training set, separated for positive (target=1, i.e., user liked the song) and negative (target=0, i.e., user disliked the song) examples. There are two different histograms, one for target = 0 and one for target = 1, and they are overlaid on top of each other. The histogram shows that extremely quiet songs tend to be disliked (more blue bars than orange on the left) and very loud songs also tend to be disliked (more blue than orange on the far right).\n",
